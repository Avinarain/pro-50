    <p>Cranes are powerful flyers, with some having the ability to fly over the Himalayas.
        During migration cranes fly with their head and neck straight out and their feet and legs straight behind them. ...
        Cranes form lifelong monogamous pair bonds.</p>
    <h2>Origami Rabbit</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QqBvy_yO_M"><img src="images/rabbit.jpg" width=300 height=300/></a>
     <p>A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe and a male is called a buck.
        Rabbits are very social creatures that live in groups. ...
        A rabbit's teeth never stop growing! ...
        Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a 'binky', when they're happy â€” performing twists and kicks in mid air!</p>
